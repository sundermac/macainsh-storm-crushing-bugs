# Crushing Bugs - HW #2

The MMED-1055 HW#2 builds upon the in-class build of the Human Anatomy Puzzle Game. The game allows the player to drag and drop labels into target zones located over different sections of the anatomy diagram. However, two bugs required fixing:

1. Multiple labels can be dropped into the same target zone.
2. The reset button does not reset the locations of the labels to their original location after being dropped into a target zone.
